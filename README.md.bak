## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Join** a round by staking MON tokens (any amount you want!)
2. **Click** as fast as you can during the 15-second round
3. **Win** the entire pot if you have the highest score (clicks × stake)
4. **Auto-payout** to the winner when the round ends

**Pro Tip:** Higher stake = more points per click! 🚀

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.18.0 or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v3.2.3)
- A crypto wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Test MON on Monad Testnet

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastest-finger-pot.git
cd fastest-finger-pot

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

#### For Hardhat (Smart Contracts)

Create a `.env` file in `packages/hardhat/`:

```bash
cd packages/hardhat
cp .env.example .env  # Copy the example file
```

Edit `.env` and add your configuration:

```env
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
MONAD_RPC_URL=https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz
MONAD_CHAIN_ID=10200
```

#### For Next.js (Frontend)

Optionally create a `.env.local` file in `packages/nextjs/` for WalletConnect:

```bash
cd packages/nextjs
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` (optional, uses defaults if not provided):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_wallet_connect_project_id
```

### 3. Set Up MetaMask for Monad Testnet

Add Monad Testnet to your MetaMask:

**Network Details:**

- **Network Name:** Monad Testnet
- **RPC URL:** `https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz`
- **Chain ID:** `10200`
- **Currency Symbol:** MON
- **Block Explorer:** `https://testnet.monadexplorer.com`

**Quick Add:**

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click "Add Network" → "Add Network Manually"
3. Enter the details above
4. Save and switch to Monad Testnet

### 4. Get Test MON

Get free test tokens from:

- **Monad Faucet:** [Add faucet URL here]
- Or request in the Monad Discord

### 5. Deploy Smart Contracts

From the root directory:

```bash
# Compile contracts
yarn compile

# Deploy to Monad Testnet
yarn deploy --network monadTestnet
```

The deployment will:

- Deploy `FastestFingerPot.sol` to Monad Testnet
- Generate TypeScript types in `packages/nextjs/contracts/`
- Create deployment artifacts in `packages/hardhat/deployments/`

### 6. Run Frontend

```bash
# Start the Next.js development server
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to play! 🎮

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Or just Hardhat tests
yarn hardhat:test

# Run tests with gas reporting
yarn test --network monadTestnet
```

Tests cover:

- ✓ Contract deployment and initialization
- ✓ Joining rounds with stakes
- ✓ Click functionality
- ✓ Winner determination
- ✓ Automatic payouts
- ✓ Score calculations
